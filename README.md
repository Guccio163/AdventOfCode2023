Advent of Code 2023 edition solutions
All the solutions are done by me, without the help of chat etc. ;)

Every task could be discribed by a title:

- day 1: nice, there's a function .isdigit()
- day 2: a lot of stripping (and splitting)
- day 3: done after a little bit of mind-flexing
- day 4: multiplier saves a lot of appending
- day 5: * - 15 minutes, ** - 4h, but well deserved win
- day 6: just multiply everything!
- day 7: jokers make a lot of new scenarios
- day 8: get LCM and submit
- day 9: aaaa, array.reverse() reverses in place
- day 10: At Code's End - Up is Down*
- day 11: just remember there are extra lines
- day 12: what is a @cache ??
- day 13: nothing better than simple solution
- day 14: well, we've been in this state before...
